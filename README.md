) Created a VHDL-based Finite State Machine 
(FSM) capable of performing 128x128 matrix multiplications and storing the results in RAM memory. The FSM efciently 
handles various components to achieve this functionality. Additionally, implemented a feature to input an address and 
display the corresponding number from the matrix on a 4x7 segment display.
